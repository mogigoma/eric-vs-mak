            <p>Eric and Mak met in Grade 11 at Nelson McIntyre Collegiate and have been friends ever since. Their lives have always been wildly different, but when they graduated high-school together, in 2001 at age 18, they were physically similar.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p>Eric took a dozens of jobs around the country, travelled the world, managed/rescued/owned several businesses, and finally settled down to buy and run a cafe. Mak went to university, got married, found a job at which he could work from his house, had three children, and avoided travel.</p>

          <p>In 2018, at age 35 and moderately overweight, they entered into a weight-loss competition with one another, with no real stakes or plan. The idea was that since they are similar in height, weight, age, and both had a desire to lose weight, they would make good opponents for one another. No progress was made. Eric became busy helping raise his nieces and managing his business. Mak became busy with his Master's degree and the birth of his third child. The health of both declined.</p>

          <p>In 2019, at age 36 and significantly overweight, they decided to try again, with several improvements. The first improvement was to transition the competition from focusing on weight loss to overall fitness. The second improvement was to have a blend of real stakes: money and public embarrassment. The next improvement was to have the competition run for a much longer duration, ending the year they turn 40, since fitness is a long-term state that must be maintained. The final improvement was to create a series of checkpoints using objective measurements to curb their natural impulse to find loopholes and game the metrics without truly improving.</p>

            <p>From September 2019 to September 2023, Eric and Mak will attempt to improve their overall fitness.</p>

            <p>(specifics and rules to be posted after the first assessment)</p>

            <p>Eric and Mak have each contributed $500 CAD to an investment account to be managed by Eric for the duration of the challenge. Eric has a deep love of finance, and intends to demonstrate his investing acumen by growing the account's value. Mak doesn't really care so long as the account's value beats inflation and the base interest rate a simple bond would return. The current value of the account will be reported each Monday during the challenge.</p>

            <p>Whoever has achieved and maintained their 'fitness' the best for the duration of the challenge, as measured at 6-month assessments, will receive the current value of the investment account when the challenge ends. More importantly, they will have bragging rights for the rest of their friendship, which will hopefully last at least another 18 years.</p>

            <p>Regardless of who wins, increased fitness for both contestants is beneficial. But winning is more beneficial.</p>
